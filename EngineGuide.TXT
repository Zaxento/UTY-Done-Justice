[Dialogue Commands]

& moves the text to the next row
Sometimes instead of "&", your text may require "#". These serve the same function, with "#" usually being used in some old parts of Undertale that weren't updated to use "&". Typically static non-dialogue text.
^1 delays the text, typically used when "," appears.
^2 delays it a bit more, typically used after a ".", "?", "!" or other notable words/phrases.
/E1, /E2, etc determine what expression the character would have.
/%% ends the dialogue box thingy and you can move and junk yay
/ is used in certain Dialogues to tell the game to look at the next dialogue after this one.
% skips to the next dialogue line I think?

[How do I make bullets?]

Bullets are pretty standalone. Monsters spawn them around where 'if (global.mnfight == 2)' is located (without quotation marks). I'd suggest copy-pasting a Monster, and switching out one of the 'gen = OBJECT' for whatever bullet you want to experiment with. I'd suggest copy-pasting a bullet for experimentation purposes too.

[Door Tip]

When placing doors, where do they take you? Well, you can set this in the creation code! Here is a basic example you can copy-paste and then edit.

next_x = 700 next_y = 140 next_room = room_ruins3

[Scenarios Tip]

Because of this Engine being used for multiple games, there is a variable used for determining which Game Scenario is being played.
